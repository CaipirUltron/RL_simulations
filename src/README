Right after cloning the repository, open a new terminal and perform the following steps:

1) cd <your path>/RL_simulations
2) catkin_make
3) echo 'source <your path>/RL_simulation/devel/setup.bash' >> ~/.bashrc
4) source ~/.bashrc

Ok! Now run:

1) roscore
2) rosrun rviz rviz -d <your path>/RL_simulation/src/rviz_map/gridMap.rviz
3) rosrun rviz_map graphics_broadcaster.py

Your should see the robot performing random movements on the grid!
Everything can be edited from the main loop inside graphics_broadcaster.py:
i) map grid size
ii) robot initial position
iii) robot initial angle

Enjoy
